Current Issues:

1) Colours are mostly correct however blended semi-transparency produces incorrect colour result.


Do To's:

1) Move IOReg to the Teensy's RAM.

2) Design a proper PCB to hold all components, no jumper wires!!

3) Finish sound implementation.

4) Start implemetation of user buttons.

5) Serious optimisation and code cleanup.

6) Proper hardware explanation and documentation.
