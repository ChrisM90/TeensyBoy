Done away with the shift registers as I didnt seem to be able to get them to work reliably, Now using a direct parallel connection. New best FPS achieved 4.5 :-)  

Current Issues:

1) Dev board is a bloody mess, jumper wires everywhere...


Do To's:

1) Design a proper PCB to hold all components, no jumper wires!!

2) Finish sound implementation.

3) Start implemetation of user buttons.

4) Serious optimisation and code cleanup.

5) Proper hardware explanation and documentation.
