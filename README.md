Current Issues:

1) SRAM read and write is still flaky this seems to be caused by some kind of contension between the shift registers and the SRAM...


Do To's:

1) Design a proper PCB to hold all components, no jumper wires!!

2) Finish sound implementation.

3) Start implemetation of user buttons.

4) Serious optimisation and code cleanup.

5) Proper hardware explanation and documentation.
