Current Issues:

1) Weird behaviour when retrieving uint8_t from SRAM not sure if caused by the write failing or the read failing, could be to do with noise from the jumper wires...

2) Colours are mostly correct however blended semi-transparency produces incorrect colour result.



Do To's:

1) Move IOReg to the Teensy's RAM.

2) Finish sound implementation.

3) Start implemetation of user buttons.

4) Serious optimisation and code cleanup.

5) Proper hardware explanation and documentation.
